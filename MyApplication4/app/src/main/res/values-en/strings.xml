    <string name="f.lass">Take your time</string>
    <string name="f.immer">Time and again you see so-called \"express recipes\" for baking bread on the internet. &#10;These promise fresh, homemade bread within a few hours - usually with the help of very large amounts of yeast. &#10;Of course, this can be useful if you want to bake fresh bread spontaneously and hardly have the time. &#10;However, if you bake more regularly and are interested in a much more intensive taste, I advise you to switch to the so-called \"long-term leavening\". &#10;For the optimal yeast quantity calculation of your favourite recipe, use this calculator.</string>
    <string name="f.jedes">Every loaf deserves to be &#10;baked!</string>
    <string name="f.nichts">" Don't rush things"</string>
    <string name="f.orga">" Get organised before baking"</string>
    <string name="f.ruck">Setbacks are part of the game - even when baking bread. &#10;Especially in the beginning, you will make many mistakes: accidentally using the wrong ingredients, wrong quantities or a classic overproofing. &#10;Often the dough looks like it should be thrown away. &#10;My advice to you: give the dough a chance and put it in the oven. &#10;Maybe the result will surprise you and you will discover a new favourite product.</string>
    <string name="f.dingen">As with so many things, no master has fallen from the sky. &#10;You should also be aware of this when choosing a recipe. &#10;Of course, recipes with an incredible number of ingredients sound incredibly exciting, but I still recommend starting with smaller recipes. &#10;Once you have a feel for different doughs and your basic recipes work, &#10;you can move on to more advanced recipes and inspire others with your knowledge.</string>
    <string name="f.vorfreude">Despite understandable anticipation of baking, structured preparation is sensible and necessary. &#10;Anyone who has ever noticed that an ingredient is missing while kneading by hand and then tried to get it out of the cupboard &#10;and weigh it with dough-smeared hands knows what I am talking about. &#10;So before you start baking, think about what you need and arrange it neatly on your work surface. &#10;If you are missing a material, get creative. &#10;For example, a pasta strainer with a kitchen towel inserted can be a great alternative to a proofing basket &#10;or you can use a flower sprayer to create steam in the oven.</string>
    <string name="f.teiglinge">" When will my dough or dough pieces be ready ?"</string>
    <string name="f.daumen">Especially at the beginning it is difficult to develop a feeling for the dough. How long do I have to knead my dough or how long does my dough have to rest? These are two questions I often asked myself at the beginning. There are simple tricks for this &#10;&#10; kneading time: For this you can take a piece of dough that is about the size of a walnut and hold it between your hands. &#10;Gently and sensitively pull the piece of dough apart with both hands so that a thin layer of dough forms. &#10;This layer of dough should be pulled so thin that light can shine through. If this thin layer of dough tears, the dough has not been kneaded enough. &#10;&#10;Proofing time: For this \"problem\" there is the so-called thumb test. &#10;Press a slight notch into your dough with your thumb. &#10;If the notch springs right back, the dough is not quite ready. &#10;If the notch does not return to its original shape, the dough has been proofing too long. &#10;For optimal proofing time, the notch springs back slightly, but not to the 100% original shape.</string>

    <string name="s.Überschrift">Holiday baking</string>
    <string name="s.BBQ">Who hasn\'t experienced it: You go on holiday and want to make a flatbread to go with the BBQ. &#10;Unfortunately, your holiday home has neither a scale nor a kneading machine. &#10;There are various solutions to these problems.</string>
    <string name="s.go">Go</string>
    <string name="s.mehlwaage">To measure the flour without scales, there is a simple solution: &#10;You use the bulk density of flour. &#10;The bulk density indicates how heavy a substance is in relation to a certain volume. Water, as an example, has a bulk density of 1, which means that 1000 ml of water weighs 1 kg. &#10;Flour, on the other hand, is lighter than water. So 1000 ml of flour weighs only about 500-600g. Now you can use a container - preferably with a calibration mark - to weigh the flour. &#10;Enter the ml number into the calculator and the number of grams will be calculated.</string>
    <string name="s.Hefewaage">To measure a quantity of yeast without a scale, you can simply form your fresh yeast into a ball. &#10;Depending on the diameter of the yeast ball, the weight of the yeast can be estimated. &#10;Simply measure the size (millimetres) of the ball with the ruler on the screen and enter the value into the calculator. &#10;The amount of yeast will be given to you in grams. Of course, these are not absolutely exact values, &#10;but it will be enough for your holidays and your spontaneous baking desire.</string>
    <string name="s.Schüssel">If you do not have space for kneading, use a bowl and a wooden spoon. &#10;This variant is based on the lift kneader used in industry. &#10;You mix all the ingredients in a bowl and mix them by hand or with a wooden spoon. &#10;In the second step, you place your mixer at one end of the bowl and pull the dough to the middle of the bowl. Then turn the bowl a few centimetres, start again at the edge and pull the dough to the middle of the bowl. &#10;Repeat this process until your dough stretches well without tearing.</string>
    <string name="s.Arbeitsflaeche">If you have a work surface for kneading, you can use this variant. &#10;There you also mix all the ingredients at the beginning. You can also use a bowl or directly your work surface for this. &#10;This method is based on a sprial kneader, which creates a force effect from top to bottom. &#10;To do this, you reach under the dough with your hand and fold it over itself. Then press the folded piece of dough into the dough from top to bottom. &#10;After this step, the bowl is turned a few centimetres and the kneading process starts again: You reach under the dough, fold it over itself and press the folded piece into the rest of the dough.</string>
    <string name="s.Kneter">To make dough without a kneader, you can use the efficiency of industrial kneaders as a guide&#10;For holidays, two methods are suitable, which differ in whether you have a worktop available for kneading or not&#10;With both methods, it should be noted that the kneading time is longer than with a machine. To estimate approximately when your dough has been kneaded long enough, there is the so-called window test. &#10;(see -Tips- When is my dough or my dough pieces ready?)</string>

    <string name="w.Woerter">Especially at the beginning, you will come across many foreign words that you don\'t know yet. To help you get started, I\'ll list the terms that are most important to me and explain them to you.</string>
    <string name="w.Stockgare">" bulk fermentation"</string>
    <string name="w.vordemformen">Rest the dough after kneading but before shaping.</string>
    <string name="w.Stueckgare">Piece fermentation:</string>
    <string name="w.vordembacken">The resting time after shaping the dough but before baking.</string>
    <string name="w.Schwaden">Swaths:</string>
    <string name="w.krumenbild">Steam is the water vapour that is added to the baking process. It ensures a better crust appearance.</string>
    <string name="w.Teigausbeute">Dough yield:</string>
    <string name="w.TAerklaert">The dough yield (TA) indicates how many kilograms of water are used per 100 kilograms of flour. The higher the TA, the more water is used. &#10;But please note: The higher the TA, the more difficult it is to process. &#10;As an example: 500 grams of flour and 300 grams of water are used in the recipe. &#10;The result is a dough yield of 160.</string>
    <string name="w.Hydration">Hydration:</string>
    <string name="w.hydrationerklaaert">Hydration is the same as TA, but is expressed as a percentage. The percentage of water is calculated in relation to the flour. &#10;As an example: 500 grams of flour and 300 grams of water are used in the recipe. &#10;The result is a hydration of 60 %.</string>
    <string name="w.griffigkeit">Grip:</string>
    <string name="w.griffigekiterklaert">Grip describes the structure of the flour. If a flour with a high grip is required, this means a dark flour with a high proportion of husks.</string>
    <string name="w.type">Type:</string>
    <string name="w.typerklaert">The type indicates how many milligrams of minerals are contained in 100 grams of flour. &#10;Since the minerals are located in the outer part of the grain, the type increases the darker the flour becomes.</string>
    <string name="w.Schluss">Conclusion:</string>
    <string name="w.schlusserklaert">When a ball of dough is formed into a shape, there is a seam. This is called the end.</string>
    <string name="w.Wirken">Work:</string>
    <string name="w.synonym">Used as a synonym for shaping the dough.</string>
    <string name="w.ausbund">Ausbund:</string>
    <string name="w.ausbunderklaert">The torn part of the crust, which is formed during the baking process, is called the collar. This can be caused by a cut or by accident.</string>

    <string name="settings.michi">Michi</string>
    <string name="settings.sebi">Sebi</string>
    <string name="VorstellungMichi">My name is Michael. My professional journey began with an apprenticeship as a food technology specialist. Even then, it was clear to me that I wanted to combine my passion for food and technology to develop innovative products and advance the food industry. In the following two years, I was allowed to work in the quality department and thus gained a deep insight into the processes and standards that are essential for the production of high-quality and safe food. After my apprenticeship, I continued my education and graduated as a technician in food technology. Now I am about to start a new chapter in my career: soon I will begin a degree in biochemistry. I am very much looking forward to this challenge as it will allow me to broaden and deepen my knowledge to delve even deeper into the scientific aspects of food development. Away from my professional career, football and music club are my great passions. In football, I not only have the opportunity to be active in sports, but also to work in a team and achieve goals together. In my free time, I am always open to new experiences. I enjoy going on hikes to enjoy nature and also like to try my hand in the kitchen to create new recipes.</string>
    <string name="VorstelungSebi">My name is Sebi and I am happy to introduce myself to you. My path began with my A-levels at the Technical High School, where I discovered my enthusiasm for technology and innovation. This was followed by my studies in computer science, which introduced me to the fascinating world of programming and digital technologies.  During my studies, I developed a particular passion for the field of autonomous driving. The idea of having vehicles navigate autonomously with the help of artificial intelligence and advanced algorithms fascinates me immensely. It is an area that is constantly growing and will have a significant impact on the future of mobility.  Besides my professional career, I am an avid mountain biker. Exploring nature and experiencing the thrill of off-road riding gives me the time out I need from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It helps me clear my head and recharge my batteries to engage in my projects and challenges.</string>
    <string name="h.sinn">This calculator is designed to help you find the optimal amount of yeast for your recipe. This can be useful if, for example, you find a recipe that you want to bake but are unhappy with the given resting time for the dough or if you prefer to store the dough in the fridge instead of at room temperature. To do this, add up the flour used in the recipe (regardless of the type of flour) and enter it under flour weight. Then think about how long you want to let your dough rest - enter the hours and minutes in the corresponding field. In the last field, enter the temperature at which the dough should rest. After you have entered all three things, click on -Calculate-. The required amounts of fresh yeast, dry yeast or sourdough are then calculated in grams.</string>
